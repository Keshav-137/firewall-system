Overview:
This project is a Python-based firewall designed to monitor and block suspicious network traffic, ensuring the security of your device from unauthorized access. The firewall works by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-configured rules and patterns, helping protect against potential threats.

Features:
1.Network Traffic Filtering: Monitors network traffic and blocks unwanted traffic.
2.IP and Port Blocking: Blocks specific IP addresses and ports to prevent unauthorized access.
3.Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time updates on the status of network traffic.
4.Customizable Rules: Allows users to define rules for filtering traffic based on IP addresses, ports, or protocols.
5.Log Generation: Keeps a log of blocked connections for analysis and troubleshooting.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
socket module (for network communication)
iptables (on Linux systems) or equivalent firewall management tools
Administrative privileges to apply firewall rules

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firewall-python.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd firewall-python
Install required dependencies (if any):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the firewall script:

bash
Copy code
python firewall.py
The script will start monitoring network traffic and applying firewall rules.

To customize firewall rules, open config.py and modify the allowed_ips, blocked_ports, or other variables.

Configuration
You can customize the following configuration settings in the config.py file:

allowed_ips: List of IP addresses allowed to connect.
blocked_ports: List of ports to block for incoming/outgoing traffic.
logging_enabled: Set to True to enable logging of blocked traffic.
Example
Block an IP Address
python
Copy code
blocked_ips = ['192.168.1.100']
Allow a Specific Port
python
Copy code
allowed_ports = [80, 443]
